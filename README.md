### What is this?
A 360 video tour created as a project for [Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.com/). A [360 video](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/360-degree_video) is an immersive video format that is displayed as a sphere around the user for a 360 degree viewing experience.

### Why?
This project was intended to familiarize ourselves with VR tools and concepts required to create interactive experiences. Examples include manipulation of a vr rig and UI interaction styles.

### How to install
Method 1 (recommended, Oculus Quest 2):
1. Download a build of the app from [here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1u7aCApAGQJoKGEs1TOKku7C1D2VyDsTo/view?usp=sharing)
2. Sideload the app onto an Oculus Quest 2 device by any means of your choice. [SideQuest](https://sidequestvr.com/) is a popular option.
3. In your headset, navigate to the 'Unknown Source' section of your apps.
4. Launch the app and enjoy!
